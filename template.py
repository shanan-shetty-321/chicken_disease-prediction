    # ðŸ”¹ Common Use Cases:
    # 
    # Functions for reading/writing files.
    # Data normalization and transformation functions.
    # Generic functions like logging, API requests, and calculations.

# Storing file paths, API keys, database settings.
# Defining model hyperparameters in an ML project like learnong rate,etc.
